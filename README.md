# smtp-email-gateway-api
This is a **Proof of Concept (POC) API** designed to simplify and optimize the process of sending emails through various email service providers. The API acts as a single interface that allows users to send emails using different providers such as Amazon SES, Google SMTP, Mailgun, and others, without needing to integrate each service separately.
